# .litrc
A lit .vimrc to hit professional yeets at the workplace

## Bundle installation (requires git)
Use this shell command to install this badboye
```
wget -O - https://github.com/dkz/.litrc/raw/master/install.sh | sh
```
And don't forget to run :PluginInstall to let vundle fetch all plugins

## Minimal installation
Imagine not being able to replicate your exact .vimrc on the remote environment
because it has no git installed.  However I've gotcha fam with this minimal
installation script that requires only wget to be present:

```
wget -O - https://github.com/dkz/.litrc/raw/master/install-minimal.sh | sh
```
